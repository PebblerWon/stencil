# Stencil Code TODOs
1. Update `@types/jest` to v30. No such types exist yet.
2. Update the CI workflow for the Component Starter smoke tests to use v30 of jest, instead of alpha 2.
3. Set the max version of Jest to '30.0.0' in node-sys
4. Restore max version check in node-sys
4. Restore max version check in task-test

# Where this branch stands

- Stencil compiles + type checks
- Stencil projects build
- Tests run (smoke test in component starter)
